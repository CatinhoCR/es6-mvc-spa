# Simple MVC Vanilla JS App

A simple (and in development) front end app made to consume a REST API and work as a single page app made with no frameworks or libraries for personal practice and career development in Vanilla JavaScript (No FE frameworks), eventually to be done with the best practices and latest standards. Focusing on making it work first.

## Installation

You will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and `NPM` installed to get this running. Will eventually move this to a Yarn build maybe and etc.
Live-Server

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Only has 1 script for now, for development. Will work on this later.
Live-server
```bash
live-server --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000   
```
```bash
npm run build
```

## Notes To Self

There are several things to do. I've tried keeping code as clean and clear as possible, but still need to optimize this, document code properly, improve a lot of stuff and implement some new cool things to build a nice reusable Vanilla ES6 FrontEnd MVC Boilerplate. This Boilerplate is the new goal of this repository. Just for fun and practice.
Look for `// *** TODO:` for comments on things still to do, improve or implement throughout the JS files.
