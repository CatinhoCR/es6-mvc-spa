# Simple MVC Vanilla JS App

A simple (and in development) front end app made to consume a REST API and work as a single page app made with no frameworks or libraries for personal practice and career development in Vanilla JavaScript (No FE frameworks), eventually to be done with the best practices and latest standards. Focusing on making it work first.

## Installation

You will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and `NPM` installed to get this running. Will eventually move this to a Yarn build maybe and etc.
Live-Server

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Only has 1 script for now, for development. Will work on this later.
Live-server
```bash
live-server --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000   
```
```bash
npm run build
```
